# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict housing prices in the Boston area. The dataset used for this analysis is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains various factors that can affect housing prices.

In this project, I conducted an analysis of housing prices in the Boston area using the Boston Housing dataset. The primary goal was to build a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various factors. Here's a brief overview of the key steps in this project:

    Data Import: I imported the Boston Housing dataset, which is available through the mlbench package in R. This dataset includes information about housing prices and associated variables.

    Data Split: To ensure the reproducibility of the model, I performed a stratified random split of the dataset into a training set and a testing set.

    Model Building: I built a linear regression model using the caret package. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on both the training and testing sets.

    Model Performance: I assessed the model's performance by calculating correlations and R-squared values. These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts housing prices.

    Visualization: I created scatter plots to visualize the model's predictions on both the training and testing sets.

This project provides a practical example of applying a linear regression model to real-world data, allowing for the prediction of housing prices in the Boston area.
